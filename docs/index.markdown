# MLgenotype: software for genotyping SVs in short read sequencing data

MLgenotype trains and utilizes random forest classifiers to recognize k-mer based sequence features indicative of 
specific structural variants.

## About the project

Efforts to use machine learning to classify known Alpha Thalassemia deletions using short read data
began in Jim Mullikin's Comparative Genomics Analysis Unit at NHGRI in 2018. After a promising pilot
project led by postdoctoral fellow Zhi Liu, two summer students, Gracelyn Hill and Jennifer Lin,
built, trained, and tested models under the supervision of Nancy Hansen.

Our primary focus was on testing the hypothesis that simulated short-read sequence data would be 
sufficiently similar to real data to enable us to train classifiers that are accurate in genotyping
data from real samples.
