The mlgenotype Python package can be used to train machine learning models to genotype structural variants using unaligned short read data (fastq or bam-formatted files), as well as to predict genotypes for samples using whole genome short read datasets.

The software was written by Nancy Fisher Hansen, a staff scientist in the Computational and Statistical Genomics Branch of NHGRI, beginning with code written by Gracelyn Hill and Jennifer C Lin. Nancy can be reached at nhansen@mail.nih.gov.
